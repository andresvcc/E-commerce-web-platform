## Introduction

Software development often involves managing complex dependencies between different components. Dependency Injection (DI) is a widely used design pattern that helps achieve loose coupling and modularity by externalizing dependencies. However, as applications grow in size and complexity, managing dependencies can become challenging. This is where Hierarchical Dependency Injection comes into play. Hierarchical Dependency Injection builds upon the principles of DI and extends them to handle dependencies in a hierarchical manner. In this article, we will explore the concept of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and its benefits in software development. We will also examine its application in the Thymio Suite V3 Project, discussing core components, the role of dependency injection, and how it aligns with clean architectures. Furthermore, we will explore the complementary relationship between Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling, a lightweight approach to visualizing software architecture. By combining these two approaches, developers can design well-structured systems and effectively communicate their architecture to stakeholders. Let's dive in and explore the power of Hierarchical Dependency Injection in managing complex dependencies and its synergy with C4 Modeling

## Hierarchical Dependency Injection

Hierarchical Dependency Injection is a powerful technique used in software development to manage dependencies between components in a hierarchical manner. It builds upon the principles of Dependency Injection (DI) and extends them to handle complex dependency structures.

#### Definition and Explanation of Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows components to be loosely coupled by externalizing their dependencies. Instead of creating dependencies within the component itself, the dependencies are provided or injected from an external source, typically known as a container or injector.

For a detailed explanation of Dependency Injection, you can refer to this [link to external resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).

#### Introduction to Hierarchical Dependency Injection

Hierarchical Dependency Injection takes the concept of Dependency Injection further by introducing a hierarchical structure for managing dependencies. It enables the composition of components at different levels, allowing for more flexible and modular systems.

The key benefits of Hierarchical Dependency Injection are:

1. **Simplified Dependency Management**: By organizing components into hierarchical layers or modules, dependencies can be injected at each level, reducing the complexity of managing dependencies.

2. **Code Reusability**: Hierarchical Dependency Injection promotes code reuse by enabling the reuse of components across different levels and modules. Components can be easily composed and combined to create new functionality.

3. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: With Hierarchical Dependency Injection, the system's architecture can be easily modified and extended by adding or replacing components at different levels. This enhances the system's flexibility and maintainability.

#### Examples of Use Cases and Scenarios

Hierarchical Dependency Injection is particularly useful in large-scale applications with complex dependency structures. Some common use cases and scenarios where Hierarchical Dependency Injection can be applied include:

- **Enterprise Applications**: In enterprise applications with multiple modules and subsystems, Hierarchical Dependency Injection can be used to manage the dependencies between different modules and ensure the overall system's integrity.

- **Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, where each microservice represents a self-contained module, Hierarchical Dependency Injection can be employed to manage the dependencies between microservices and facilitate communication between them.

- **Plugin-based Systems**: Hierarchical Dependency Injection can be utilized in plugin-based systems to dynamically load and inject dependencies based on the installed plugins. This allows for extensibility and modularity in the system.

#### Overview of the Roles Involved

Hierarchical Dependency Injection involves different roles, each playing a specific part in the system. These roles include:

- **Actor**: An Actor represents a user or an entity that interacts with the system. Actors initiate actions and coordinate the execution of use cases. They rely on the services and data provided by other components. They rely on the services and data provided by the Bounded Contexts.

- **Bounded Context**: A Bounded Context represents a cohesive area of the system that encapsulates a specific domain or functionality. It interact with other Bounded Contexts, services, or stores to fulfill their responsibilities.

- **Service**: Services are components that encapsulate specific functionality or behavior. They perform operations and implement business logic to fulfill use cases. Services may interact with other services, stores, or external systems to complete their tasks.

- **Store**: Stores are responsible for managing and persisting data within a Bounded Context. They provide an interface for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data required by the system. Stores can be databases, file systems, or any other form of data storage.

Understanding the relationships and interactions between these roles is essential for designing and implementing a system that effectively utilizes Hierarchical Dependency Injection.

finally, Hierarchical Dependency Injection is a powerful technique that enhances the flexibility, modularity, and maintainability of software systems. By leveraging the concept of Dependency Injection in a hierarchical structure, dependencies between components can be managed effectively. The roles of Actors, Bounded Contexts, Services, and Stores play a crucial part in implementing Hierarchical Dependency Injection and ensuring the system's smooth operation.


## Hierarchical Dependency Injection in Thymio Suite V3 Project

Before delving into the workings of the Hierarchical Dependency Injection System, it's important to understand the concept of clean architectures. Clean architectures provide a way to organize and structure code in an application to achieve high modularity, separation of concerns, and ease of maintenance.

In a clean architecture, clear separation is established between different layers of the application, such as the presentation layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer. Each layer has its own responsibilities and dependencies, and communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.

The Hierarchical Dependency Injection System aligns with the principles of clean architectures by facilitating dependency management and promoting modularity and separation of concerns.

### Core Components

#### Decorators
The Hierarchical Dependency Injection System uses several decorators to mark and configure components in the application. These decorators indicate the role of each component in the hierarchy and facilitate dependency injection.

- `@Actor({ key: string, predicate?: Predicate })`: This decorator is used to mark a class as an Actor in the hierarchy. An Actor represents a primary component in the application and can contain one or more Bounded Contexts. The decorator accepts two attributes: `key`, which defines the unique key of the Actor, and `predicate` (optional), which specifies a predicate to select the appropriate implementation of the Actor based on the context.

- `@BoundedContext({ key: string, predicate?: Predicate })`: This decorator is used to mark a class as a Bounded Context in the hierarchy. A Bounded Context represents a bounded context within an Actor and can contain one or more Services or Stores. The decorator accepts two attributes: `key`, which defines the unique key of the Bounded Context, and `predicate` (optional), which specifies a predicate to select the appropriate implementation of the Bounded Context based on the context.

- `@Service({ key: string, predicate?: Predicate })`: This decorator is used to mark a class as a Service in the hierarchy. A Service represents a component that provides specific functionality and can be used by other components in the hierarchy. The decorator accepts two attributes: `key`, which defines the unique key of the Service, and `predicate` (optional), which specifies a predicate to select the appropriate implementation of the Service based on the context.

- `@Store({ key: string, predicate?: Predicate })`: This decorator is used to mark a class as a Store in the hierarchy. A Store represents a data store and is used to store and retrieve information. The decorator accepts two attributes: `key`, which defines the unique key of the Store, and `predicate` (optional), which specifies a predicate to select the appropriate implementation of the Store based on the context.

#### Container
The Container is the central component of the Hierarchical Dependency Injection System. It is responsible for managing dependency injection and storing instances of components.

- `Container.addInjectable(injectable: Injectable)`: This method is used to register an injectable component in the Container. It takes an `Injectable` object that contains information such as the key, name, role, and predicate associated with the component.

- `Container.get(role: Role, key: string, arbitraryPredicate?: Predicate, args?: Object): any`: This method is used to retrieve an instance of a component from the Container. It takes the role and

 key of the component, an optional predicate to select the appropriate implementation, and additional arguments for component construction. It returns the corresponding instance of the component or `undefined` if no instance is found.

- `Container.instantiates(): Injectables`: This method returns an `Injectables` object that contains the injectable components registered in the Container. It provides information about the available components in each role of the hierarchy.

- `factoryFromInjectable`: This method allows creating a factory function for a specific injectable component. It takes the following parameters:

  | Parameter        | Description                                                                                           |
  |------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `role: string`   | Specifies the role or key of the component.                                                           |
  | `name: string`   | Specifies the name or identifier for the factory function.                                            |
  | `predicate: Predicate` | (Optional) Specifies a predicate or condition to select the appropriate implementation of the component. |
  | `args: Object`   | (Optional) Additional arguments to pass to the factory function.                                      |

#### `@inject` Decorator
The `@inject` decorator is used to mark constructor parameters that need to be injected. It allows specifying the key and predicate of the injection.

- Usage: `@inject({ key: string, predicate?: Predicate })`

Example:
```typescript
class MyClass {
  constructor(@inject({ key: 'MyDependency' }) myDependency: MyDependency) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### `samePredicate` Function
The `samePredicate` function is used to compare two predicates and determine if they are equal. This is useful for selecting the appropriate implementation of a component based on the specified predicate.

- Usage: `samePredicate(a: Predicate, b: Predicate): boolean`

Example:
```typescript
const result = samePredicate(['online'], ['online']); // true
```

### Benefits of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and Clean Architectures in Thymio Suite V3 Project

The combination of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and Clean Architectures offers several benefits in application development:

1. Modularity and Separation of Concerns: Hierarchical dependency injection enables clear separation of concerns between components of the application. Each component has a specific role and depends only on the interfaces of other components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and perform unit testing.

2. Component Reusability: By using dependency injection, components can be reused in different contexts and scenarios. This promotes modularity and reduces code duplication, leading to increased productivity and efficiency in development.

3. Flexible Configuration: The ability to select different implementations of components based on the context or predicate provides great flexibility in configuring the application. This allows the application to adapt to different environments and scenarios without modifying the source code.

4. Ease of Maintenance: Clean architectures, combined with hierarchical dependency injection, facilitate code maintenance. The modular structure and separation of concerns allow for isolated changes and improvements without impacting other components of the application.

5. Unit Testing: Dependency injection facilitates writing unit tests by allowing the substitution of real dependencies with simulated or mocked implementations. This helps ensure code quality and reliability.

In summary, the Hierarchical Dependency Injection System and Clean Architectures offer a robust approach to application development, promoting modularity, reusability, flexibility, and ease of code maintenance.

## Hierarchy of Roles in Clean Architecture and How They Work

The Clean Architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns and a modular design. Within this architecture, different roles play distinct roles in organizing and implementing the application's logic. The key roles involved are Actor, Bounded Context, Service, and Store. Let's explore the hierarchy between these roles, their implications in Clean Architecture, define use cases, provide examples, explain how they work, and discuss the code that enables dependency injection.

### Actor

The Actor represents a user or an entity that interacts with the application. Actors encapsulate specific use cases and are responsible for coordinating and executing actions related to those use cases.

**Implications in Clean Architecture:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Actors enable a clear separation of responsibilities related to specific use cases. Each Actor focuses on a particular set of actions and is responsible for carrying out those use cases consistently.

2. **High Cohesion**: Actors encapsulate related use cases in a cohesive entity. This improves modularity and facilitates code maintenance since the logic for each use case is located in a specific place.

3. **Flow Control**: Actors coordinate and control the execution flow of use cases. They determine which use cases to invoke and in what order, using services and data provided by other components of the system.

4. **Interaction with Bounded Contexts**: Actors interact with Bounded Contexts to access the services and data required to perform their use cases. A Bounded Context is responsible for providing the functionalities and data storage mechanisms required by the Actors.

**Use Case Example:**

```typescript
@BoundedContext({ key: 'PurchaseContext' })
class PurchaseContext {
  private readonly purchaseService: PurchaseService;

  constructor(@inject({ key: 'PurchaseService' }) purchaseService: PurchaseService) {
    this.purchaseService = purchaseService;
  }

  purchase(productID: string) {
    this.purchaseService.purchase(productID);
  }

  pay() {
    this.purchaseService.pay();
  }
}

@Actor({ key: 'Buyer' })
class Buyer {
  private readonly purchaseContext: PurchaseContext;

  constructor(@inject({ key: 'PurchaseContext' }) purchaseContext: PurchaseContext) {
    this.purchaseContext = purchaseContext;
  }

  purchase(productID: string) {
    this.purchaseContext.purchase(productID);
  }

  pay() {
    this.purchaseContext.pay();
  }
}
```

In this example, the Buyer Actor represents a buyer in a purchase context. The Actor interacts with the PurchaseContext Bounded Context to perform purchase-related actions, such as purchasing a product and making the corresponding payment.

### Bounded Context

The Bounded Context represents a clearly defined and cohesive domain within the application. It encapsulates a set of related entities, business rules, and services.

**Implications in Clean Architecture:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By defining a specific context within the application, a clear separation of different areas or aspects of the system is achieved. Each Bounded Context focuses on a particular set of entities and business rules, making code maintenance and understanding easier.

2. **High Cohesion**: Within a Bounded Context, all entities, services, and business rules are closely related and share a common purpose. This promotes high cohesion within each context, meaning that components are strongly related and work together to fulfill the specific requirements of that context.

3. **Reduced Coupling**: Each Bounded Context has its own models, interfaces, and internal logic, which reduces coupling between different contexts. Changes made within one Bounded Context have minimal impact on other contexts, facilitating system evolution and maintenance.

4. **Communication through Interfaces**: Bounded Contexts interact with each other through clearly defined interfaces. These interfaces establish contracts and specify how different contexts can communicate and share information

. This controlled communication through interfaces avoids direct dependencies between contexts.

**Use Case Example:**

```typescript
@BoundedContext({ key: 'PurchaseContext' })
class PurchaseContext {
  // ...
}

@BoundedContext({ key: 'InventoryContext' })
class InventoryContext {
  // ...
}
```

In this example, two Bounded Contexts, PurchaseContext and InventoryContext, represent different domains within the application. Each context encapsulates entities, business rules, and services specific to its domain.

### Service

The Service represents a specific piece of business functionality that exists outside of domain entities. It provides operations and logic used to fulfill use cases and business rules of the application.

**Implications in Clean Architecture:**

1. **Separation of Responsibilities**: Services allow for a clear separation of responsibilities within an application. They encapsulate business logic and operations related to specific use cases while ensuring adherence to business rules.

2. **Code Reusability**: Services are designed to be reusable and focused on providing specific functionality. This facilitates their use in different contexts and use cases within the application.

3. **Maintainability and Scalability**: By separating business logic into Services, code becomes more maintainable and scalable. Services can be modified and improved without directly affecting Stores, enabling changes to the logic without impacting the data layer. Similarly, Stores can be optimized and scaled independently of Services.

**Use Case Example:**

```typescript
@Service({ key: 'PurchaseService' })
class PurchaseService {
  // ...
}
```

In this example, the PurchaseService represents the business logic and operations related to purchasing products. It may interact with other components, such as Stores, to fulfill its functionality.

### Store

The Store is responsible for managing and storing data within the application. It acts as a persistence layer that allows for storing and retrieving data required for the application's operation.

**Implications in Clean Architecture:**

1. **Separation of Responsibilities**: Stores handle data management and persistence, separate from the business logic. They provide operations for reading, writing, and deleting data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

2. **Reusability**: Stores provide an abstraction layer for accessing and manipulating data, allowing for reusability across different parts of the application.

3. **Maintainability and Scalability**: Separating data management into Stores improves code maintainability and scalability. Stores can be optimized and scaled independently of the business logic, allowing for efficient data handling.

**Use Case Example:**

```typescript
@Store({ key: 'ProductStore' })
class ProductStore {
  // ...
}
```

In this example, the ProductStore represents the storage and management of product data. It provides operations to create, retrieve, and manipulate product data within the application.

### Code and Dependency Injection

The Clean Architecture relies on a code structure that enables dependency injection to ensure loose coupling and modularity. In the provided examples, decorators such as `@Actor`, `@BoundedContext`, `@Service`, and `@Store` are used to annotate classes and specify their roles. These decorators facilitate the configuration and injection of dependencies between different components.

The code responsible for dependency injection uses these decorators to identify the roles of the components and their relationships. By using a dependency injection container or framework, dependencies are resolved and injected into the appropriate components at runtime.

This enables the components (Actors, Bounded Contexts, Services, and Stores) to collaborate seamlessly while maintaining separation of concerns and adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture.

In conclusion, the hierarchy between the roles (Actor, Bounded Context, Service, and Store) in Clean Architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, high cohesion, and loose coupling. Actors interact with Bounded Contexts to initiate use cases, Bounded Contexts coordinate business logic through Services and

data storage through Stores. The code leverages decorators and dependency injection to facilitate the configuration and collaboration between these components, resulting in a modular and maintainable architecture.


## C4 Modeling

C4 Modeling is a lightweight and pragmatic approach to visualize and communicate software architecture. It provides a set of simple, hierarchical diagrams that enable stakeholders to understand the system's key aspects and make informed decisions. The C4 model focuses on four levels of abstraction: Context Diagram, Container Diagram, Component Diagram, and Class Diagram.

#### Introduction to C4 Modeling

C4 Modeling aims to facilitate effective communication and comprehension of software architecture by providing a clear and concise representation of the system. It helps stakeholders, including developers, architects, and non-technical team members, gain insights into the system's structure and dynamics. For a detailed introduction to C4 Modeling and its purpose, you can refer to this [link to external resource](https://c4model.com/).

#### Overview of the C4 Model's Levels of Abstraction

The C4 model consists of four levels of abstraction, each representing a different perspective of the system:

1. **Context Diagram**: The Context Diagram captures the system's scope, external entities, and their interactions. It showcases the boundaries of the system and its dependencies on external services, systems, or users. The diagram typically includes boxes representing the system and its external entities, and arrows depicting the interactions between them.

2. **Container Diagram**: The Container Diagram provides an overview of the system's major containers or applications. It shows how the containers interact, communicate, and collaborate to deliver the system's functionality. The diagram includes boxes representing the containers and arrows indicating the communication paths and dependencies between them.

3. **Component Diagram**: The Component Diagram zooms in on a specific container and illustrates its internal components or subsystems. It showcases the key building blocks and their relationships within the container. The diagram includes boxes representing the components and arrows indicating the dependencies and interactions between them.

4. **Class Diagram**: The Class Diagram depicts the internal structure of a component or a class within a container. It shows the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. The diagram includes boxes representing classes and lines representing associations, inheritance, or other relationships between classes.


## Complementarity of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling

Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling are two powerful concepts that can be effectively combined to design and visualize complex software systems. By leveraging the benefits of both approaches, developers can create well-structured architectures that are easy to understand, maintain, and communicate. This section explores the complementarity of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling and provides guidelines for using C4 diagrams to visualize a system that implements Hierarchical Dependency Injection.

#### Explanation of how Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling complement each other

Hierarchical Dependency Injection, as discussed earlier, enables the creation of a modular and loosely coupled system by managing dependencies and promoting the separation of concerns. On the other hand, C4 Modeling provides a structured approach to visualize and communicate the architecture of a software system. By combining these two approaches, developers can not only design a robust and maintainable system but also effectively convey its structure and interactions to stakeholders.

When using Hierarchical Dependency Injection in a software system, it is essential to visualize the relationships and interactions between the various components. C4 Modeling offers a set of diagrams that can effectively capture these aspects. The Context Diagram provides an overview of the system and its external actors, while the Container Diagram focuses on the high-level containers and their relationships. The Component Diagram delves deeper into the internal components and their interactions, and the Class Diagram provides a detailed view of the classes and their relationships.

To visualize a system that implements Hierarchical Dependency Injection using C4 Modeling, start with a Context Diagram to identify the external actors and their interactions with the system. Then, create a Container Diagram to represent the high-level containers, which could include the Bounded Contexts, Services, and Stores. Next, use Component Diagrams to break down each container into its internal components and depict the dependencies between them. Finally, the Class Diagram can be used to illustrate the detailed structure and relationships within each component.

#### Guidelines and best practices for modeling such a system using C4 diagrams

When modeling a system that implements Hierarchical Dependency Injection using C4 diagrams, it is important to follow certain guidelines and best practices:

- Maintain clarity and simplicity: Keep the diagrams concise and focused on the essential elements. Avoid overcrowding the diagrams with unnecessary details that might confuse the readers.

- Use consistent notation: Ensure that the notation used in the diagrams is consistent throughout the documentation. This helps in maintaining clarity and makes it easier for readers to understand the diagrams.

- Provide appropriate levels of abstraction: Use the different levels of C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component, and Class) to provide the right level of abstraction. This allows readers to grasp the system's architecture at different levels of detail.

- Document dependencies and relationships: Clearly indicate the dependencies and relationships between the components in the diagrams. This helps in understanding the flow of data and the interactions between different parts of the system.

- Update diagrams as the system evolves: As the system evolves and changes, ensure that the C4 diagrams are kept up to date. This ensures that the documentation remains accurate and reflects the current state of the system.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the combination of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling offers a powerful approach to software development, promoting modularity, code reusability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

Hierarchical Dependency Injection allows for effective management of dependencies between components, enabling loose coupling and modular systems. By leveraging dependency injection with the help of decorators and a container, components can collaborate seamlessly while maintaining separation of concerns.

C4 Modeling provides a structured and concise way to visualize and communicate the software architecture. With its different levels of abstraction, such as Context, Container, Component, and Class diagrams, C4 Modeling enables stakeholders to understand the system's structure and make informed decisions.

By combining Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling, developers can design well-structured architectures that are easy to understand, maintain, and communicate. The hierarchical structure and dependency management provided by Hierarchical Dependency Injection align well with the visual representation of the system offered by C4 Modeling.

Together, these approaches empower developers to create modular, reusable, and scalable software systems while effectively conveying their architecture to stakeholders. The complementary nature of Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling promotes the development of robust, maintainable, and easily comprehensible software systems.

In summary, Hierarchical Dependency Injection and C4 Modeling are complementary approaches that, when combined, provide a solid foundation for software development. By applying these concepts, developers can create modular, maintainable, and understandable systems, contributing to the success of software development projects.
